# Parking Lot System
### W2023 - ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering

## Project Overview
In a team of 6, we are developing an application that will assist in the operation of a parking lot business. Following the software engineering process, the team will adhere to the four key activities in software engineering as part of their working structure: Specification, development, validation and evolution. 

The application will improve the overall experience for customers, employees and managers. Its main features are listed as follows:
1. Customer Accounts: Customers with accounts will be able to create a profile in order to reserve monthly parking spots and request additional services offered by the parling lot business.
2. Employee Accounts: Employees will each own an account for management purposes, specifically allowing them to assign parking spots to monthly customers.
3. Manager Account: The manager's account will provide additional functionality, above that of an employee, where they can decide on opening hours, employee schedules, etc.
4. Tickets: The system will also allow the general public to pay for a parking spot, without the need of an account.
